# immutable-infra
This project is an Immutable Infrastructure Deployment System that uses Packer to build versioned machine images and Terraform to deploy them on AWS in a reliable, repeatable way. Instead of modifying servers after they are created, this system rebuilds and replaces them entirely, ensuring consistent environments with no configuration drift. It also supports modern deployment strategies—blue/green, rolling, and canary—allowing safe updates with automated health checks and rollback if something goes wrong. Overall, the project provides a clean, automated pipeline for building and deploying infrastructure the immutable way.
